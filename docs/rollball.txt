Program: RollBall Version 0.99
         Copyright (C) by Stangl Roman, 1992
         RollBall is Shareware - it can be freely:
            distributed, but the code or program musn't be used in any
                commercial product, without contacting me prior.
            modified, provided the complete source code is attached
                (preferable the unmodified, and the modified version).
                This program musn't be ported to MS WINDOWS, because OS/2 is
                the operating system of the future for PCs and workstations.

         !!! You are encouraged to distribute this program, under the      !!!
         !!! conditions mentioned in this document. Please load the        !!!
         !!! complete program up to your favourite BBS-Board/FTP-Server.   !!!

         RollBall is a true 32Bit, multithreaded Presentation Manager program,
         developed for and under OS/2 2.0.

Requirements:
         A PC with about 20-33 Mhz 80386,
         OS/2 2.0 GA,
         at least VGA, but a coprocessed video (f.e. 8514/A, XGA) greatly
            improves performance,
         a mouse or trackball (or equivalent), sorry there's no keyboard
            support,
         a maximum of 400kB disk space.

RollBall is game of my proprietary design. The goal of any player is, to roll
RollBall (the red moving circle) of points (the colored circles) to get
points. RollBall will be reflected by the borders of the playing ground (the
borders of the Presentation Manager window), and deflected by the deflectors,
the / and \ symbols.
But beware of the holes (the black surronded dark circles), if you get in
contact with one, you lose your life.
Points, deflectors and holes randomly disappear and appear. Rolling over any
point or deflector also removes them. To place a deflector, you use the mouse.
The left mouse butten will place a \ deflector, and the right button will
place a / deflector.

I developed this program in about 3 Weeks in August. Because this is my first
try to program the Presentation Manager there may and will be some bugs. I
don't have any experience with programming PM, so there may be also more
efficient steps to to some things, but I have good knowledge in C and of data
structures and algorithms. For almoust any API (application program interface)
I check the return value or error code, so there's a good chance, that a bug
causes a message box to be displayed, giving the error and location in source
code.

Because OS/2 is a multitasking and multithreaded operating system, it is very
difficult, to get an exact time bases. Because I haven't found any efficient
solution to implement a time bases, this progam may be slow an slow machines
(16Mhz 386sx) and too fast on fast machines (50Mhx 80486). The only solution
is to add a delay loop in THREAD.C, but this requires a recompilition.


******************************************************************************

*** Developers, please read the following: ***

The development was done with:
    IBM PS/2 80 (24Mhz without any cache)
    IBM 8514/A  (Adapter and monitor at 1024*768*256)
    OS/2 2.0 GA (on a HPFS volume)
    IBM C Set/2 1.0 GA
but the program should run, or can be compiled, on any PC. Some things to
remember are:
    Use of non GA (general availability) versions of OS/2 and/or Toolkit
    may produce unexpected results.
    Because this is an OS/2 PM Program, I can't do low level things as in DOS.
    The program makes heavy use of GPI_BitBlt, which may be slow on standard
    VGA. On a coprocessed video card (f.e. 8514/A, XGA, TIGA,...) GPI_BitBlt
    is done by hardware, and therefore much faster. Performance may also be
    sufficient on 16 Bit VGA or possibly with the coming 32bit graphics
    enginge of OS/2.
There's a makefile, that can be used with NMAKE of C Set/2. The used options
are described. The debug options are enabled, so you should be able, to use
IPMD without any difficulties.

If you have any suggestions or any improvements, you may contact me. If I have
time, I will try to support RollBall in the future (at least the next half
year). You are encouraged, to improve this program under the conditions,
mentioned above.

Known Bugs:
    The first time you select Options->Pause you will get an General Error,
    of type UNKNOWN. It can be ignored (retry does the same) without any
    problems. As I said, I check almoust any API for errors, and this error,
    returned by PM, is somewhere in an error-queue I think.
 
    Because, I haven't found any efficient implementation of a time bases,
    the speed of the game is proportional to the speed of the PC. To slow
    the game down, you must add a delay loop in THREAD.C. I possibly try
    to find a more practicable solution for this problem (adjusting thread
    priority or so?).
 
    Switching between the playing window, and other windows or the dialog
    boxes sometimes hides RollBall. In this case Options->Pause and Options->
    Unpause let you continue. The problem is, that if the playing ground
    is not selected, RollBall should stop from moving. I haven't found any
    good method, to check which window has the input focus.
